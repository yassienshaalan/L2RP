## Learning to Rank Items of Minimal Reviews Using Weak Supervision

-	L2RP is a learning to rank technique that can be used in ranking products based on customer reviews. The main idea is to learn a ranking function from products having many reviews to transfer this knolwedge to product categories having less reviews in a weakly supervised setting.
